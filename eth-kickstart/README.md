This is the main project in the "Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer's Guide" course.

It implements a Kickstarter-like Dapp, where each money withdrawal request by the campaign owner must be approved by at least half of the contributors.

Tech stack used: React + Next.js for the web app, the newest version of Web3 v1.0.0 beta and compilation/deployment by plain javascript (no truffle).
